# ConvoNet
File backup for handwritten MATLAB convolutional network

# About
This repository is a backup for all files in my handwritten convolutional network.  All files will be written in MATLAB and do not use any MathWorks or open-source toolboxes, and have been tested to run on R2019a.
By nature of the repository acting as a backup, many of the files on this repositoy will be incomplete or in a state of partial completion.  Any contributions are welcome.
